Deadline will be Friday 20th of May 18:00.

à Picture this: you walk in the door to the office, you’re attacked by a giant inflatable gorilla and you get shot by a nerf gun… You survive, you’re happy and you finally find your desk with a note from your boss on your screen:

Hey………..! Sorry I won’t be in the office for the next 2 weeks. I just won a cruise in the Caribbean’s and need to fly to Miami immediately (yes, I did a super-express Covid test yesterday and I’m totally safe to fly!).

Can you please take care of our client request for me? They need us to deliver their App before Friday 20th of May 18:00, with the requirements below:

 

The App should be in Typescript React, with all fundamentals. It should have minimum:

 

•            2 views

•            One form to add and store data + another form to edit them

•            The possibility to delete all elements displayed

•            Data storage should be done locally in the App

•            The App should be user-friendly and look nice

•            The concept should be original and different than a standard App – the kind of App that the client will buy immediately!

 


Thanks for this, ………..– You rock!
